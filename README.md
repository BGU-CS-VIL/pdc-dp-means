# pdc-dp-means: scalable $K$-Means-like clustering when $K$ is unknown
This is a placeholder for the code (coming soon!) for our UAI 2022 paper, "Revisiting DP-Means: Fast Scalable Algorithms via Parallelism and Delayed Cluster Creation".
Authors: Or Dinari and Oren Freifeld

In short: we provide  *highly scalable and fast* solutions for $K$-Means-like clustering when $K$ is unknown. Our solutions are orders of magnitude faster than the existing approaches (as of June 2022). In terms of performance, our results are usually either better than, or similar to, those of existing approaches.
